This template folder contains example files. Copy them into place and modify them to use.

Why not symlink these?

 - package.json - will probably want local edits
 - webpack.config.js - copy exactly (but we cant symlink it as it goes wrong if symlinked)
 - runtest.js - copy exactly (but we cant symlink it as it goes wrong if symlinked)
 - nginx-config - needs a tweak to set the domain name
 - index.html - probably wants local tweaks e.g. footer
